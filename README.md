## Hi there!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è


### About Me


Hello! I‚Äôm **Nicole Ely** and welcome to my GitHub.

Here you‚Äôll find a little bit of everything, from class projects in database and data analysis courses to personal projects. I have a strong passion for data analysis and telling a story with that data, especially in non-profit settings.

Currently, I‚Äôm living a double life as a data analyst for Florida Polytechnic University, as well as an *engineering management master‚Äôs student* there as well. I‚Äôve also graduated with my *bachelor‚Äôs in data science, with a minor in big data analytics* in 2022 (also from Florida Poly). I also attended New College of Florida for a year previously, where I originally majored in biology, but switched to data science after dipping my toes in for a publication in herpetology. I spend my days using data and predictions to help my team raise money for students, which I think is very fun and cool!

There are a few things I‚Äôm also passionate about, like my single-eared cat, Kelli. On my remote days, she's the best assistant.

I also love paint-by-numbers, coffee, and listening to cyber crime podcasts in my free time.
